# CryptoTrackPro

## Overview
CryptoTrackPro is a cryptocurrency tracking application that leverages the CLEAN architecture with MVVM design pattern. It provides users with detailed information about various cryptocurrencies using the coinpaprika API service. The app is built using Retrofit for API communication and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection.

## Features
- View a list of cryptocurrency coins
- Access detailed information for each coin
- CLEAN architecture for maintainability and scalability
- MVVM design pattern for a structured and modular codebase
- Retrofit for efficient and easy API communication
- Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, promoting code maintainability

## Architecture
The application follows the CLEAN architecture, which separates concerns into different layers:
- **Presentation Layer (MVVM):** Handles UI logic and user interactions.
- **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer:** Manages data retrieval and storage.

## Tech Stack
- **Retrofit:** Used for making API requests and handling responses.
- **Dagger Hilt:** Enables efficient dependency injection for improved code structure.
- **coinpaprika API:** Provides accurate and up-to-date cryptocurrency information.
